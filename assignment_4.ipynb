    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: [] is an empty list. In Python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [] , separated by commas. A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: spam[2]='hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: 'd'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: 'd'\n",

    "5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: 'a','b'\n",

    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: [3.14, 11, 'cat,' True]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: append() will add value at end of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "insert() will add value anywhere in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The del statement and the remove() list method are two ways to remove values from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both list values and string values have indexes.\n",
    "- Both can be concatenated or replicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: list is mutable while tuples is immutable.Also, tuples are written using parentheses (), while lists use the square brackets [].\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: (42)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The tuple() and list() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: They contain references to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list. That is, only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list."
