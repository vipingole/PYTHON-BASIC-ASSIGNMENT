    "\n",
    "'Hello, world!'[:5]\n",
    "\n",
    "'Hello, world!'[3:]\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: The expressions evaluate to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'e'\n",
    "* 'Hello'\n",
    "* 'Hello'\n",
    "* 'lo world!\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the values of the following expressions?\n",
    "'Hello'.upper()\n",
    "'Hello'.upper().isupper()\n",
    "'Hello'.upper().lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: the expressions evaluate to the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* ['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'July.']\n",
    "* 'There-can-only-one.'\n",
    "\n",
