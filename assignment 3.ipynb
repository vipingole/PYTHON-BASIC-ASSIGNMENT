    "1.Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Some of advantageous of function are Reducing duplication of code,\n",
    "Decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces,\n",
    "Improving clarity of the code and\n",
    "Reuse of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: def FUNCTION_NAME(PARAMETER):\n",
    "            \n",
    "            (FUNCTION BODY)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: A function is a piece of code which enhanced the reusability and modularity of your program. It means that piece of code need not be written again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function call means invoking or calling that function. Unless a function is called there is no use of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS\n",
    "\n",
    "6.What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:the local variable can be used outside the function any time after the function call completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value 'None' is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "YES, value of the expression following the return keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: If a function doesn't specify a return value, it returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: If we want to refer to a global variable in a function, we can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: None is used to define a null value. It is not the same as an empty string, False, or a zero. It is a data type of the class NoneType object\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: It imports a module called areallyourpetsnamederic in the programe.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: When an error occurs, Python will normally stop and generate an error message. These exceptions can be handled using the try statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "14.What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The try clause lets you test a block of code for errors.\n",
    "The except clause lets you handle the error."
